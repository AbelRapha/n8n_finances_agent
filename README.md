## This project features an AI-powered agent designed to manage your personal financial records with ease and simplicity. Using natural language commands, users can:
- 📝 Register expenses or income
- 🔍 Search previous financial entries
- ✏️ Update existing records
- ❌ Delete unnecessary items
All operations are automatically synced with a personal Google Sheets spreadsheet — no manual entry required.
## 🚀 How It Works
Whether you're chatting through a bot or triggering actions via an automation platform like n8n, your message is processed by the AI agent, which extracts key information such as:
- Description
- Value (R$)
- Category (e.g., Food, Transportation, Salary)
- Whether it's an expense
- Parceling information
- Payment method
- Status (Pending or Confirmed)
Once processed, the entry is updated in Google Sheets, and you’ll receive a brief confirmation message.
## 📦 Technologies Used
- n8n for orchestration and automation
- Gemini 2.5 and DeepSeek
- Telegram Bot for user interaction
- Google Sheets API for data storage
## 💡 Why This Project?
Managing finances shouldn’t require complex forms or spreadsheets. This AI agent lets you chat your way to clarity, saving time while providing smart, flexible control of your budget.
